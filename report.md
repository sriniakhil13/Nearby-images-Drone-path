1. I have used haversine formula to calculate distance between two points
2. I have also extracted Kml file of drone path 
3. I have calculated distance between each and every point in SRT file with points extracted from images which are geotagged and added to output.csv file if distance less than 35m.
4. For assets.csv file i did in same way calculated distance and if less than 50m, i added to ouput_assets.csv

***Note:*** 
Images vary if accuracy of radius of earth is varied. I used radius of earth as 6371km
